The abstract class design includes variables name and color as well as getter and setter methods for both variables for any shape automatically. The abstract methods draw() and getArea() are included and meant to be overrided by each child class that extends the shape class. All variables can be initalized by a constructor. All methods are shown in main.
The interface design includes the getArea abstract method for Calculable and the draw abstract method for Drawable. Each class made for this design inlcudes all the same variables and methods from the abstract design however each individual class has it's own variable declarations and getter and setter methods written in each class. In main, the same methods are used but written for the interface design.

Picking whether to use abstract classes or interfaces matter in real-world scenarios as it affects the designs of code you may write. Knowing the differences and the effects of either design can help improve the efficiency and flexibilty of your code. Not knowing what to choose can hurt your design choices down the road.
